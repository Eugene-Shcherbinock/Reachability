# Reachability

Simple network status tracker for Android like an [iOS Reachability library][4]

![ReachabilitySample](assets/sample.gif)

## Usage

Get a Reachability instance:

```kotlin
    mReachability = Reachability.getInstance(view.getContext())
```

Add an observer for reachability status changes:

```kotlin
    mReachability.addListener(object : ReachabilityStateObserver {
        override fun onReachabilityStateChange(newState: Reachability.State) {
                
        }
    })
```

or simply implement `ReachabilityStateObserver` to your class:

```kotlin
    class YourClass : ReachabilityStateObserver {}
```

and add `this` as a listener:

```kotlin
    mReachability.addListener(this)
```

You should use `startNotifier()` method for start listening of Network state changes:

```kotlin
    mReachability.startNotifier()
```

When you don't need to listen changes, you can use `stopNotifier()` method:

```kotlin
    mReachability.stopNotifier()
```

Please, don't forget to remove your observer with `removeListener()` method if it's not needed anymore:
```kotlin
    mReachability.removeListener(this)
```

##### Also, you can see an usage example [here][2].
